## Another starter kit...

Yup, This is my setup to start with a React project that includes some things I want to try, not sure if I like it jet. What I don't like by the current JS stack world is that everybody is up their own asses. Yet, somewhere in those asses is a way to code better and since I've been using React lately, I like the way it is to build bigger applications. So, here's a setup I'm willing to try.

## Includes

- Babel
- Eslint
- Express
- Flow
- Husky
- Jest
- JSS
- React
- Webpack
